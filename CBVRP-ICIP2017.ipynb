    "## Motivation\n",
    "Video Relevance computation is one of the most important tasks for personalized online streaming service. Given the relevance of videos and the users watch/search behaviors, recommender system can provide personalized recommendations, which will help users to discover more contents of interests. In most online service, the computation of video relevance table is based on the usersâ€™ behavior. For example, given the watch behaviors of users, Matrix Factorization can be used to model the interaction between users and videos, then the features of videos from matrix factorization can be used to compute the video relevance tables. However, computing video relevance from the content directly, instead of as a byproduct from matrix factorization of user behaviors, is a more promising and challenging tasks, where the content of videos contains the pixels, audios, subtitles and metadata of videos. Since the content of videos contains almost all the information about a video, ideally, we can have enough information to build video relevance table only from contents. One advantage of content-based video relevance prediction is that the cold start problems can be alleviated, as we do not need the user behaviors for a new video. However, understanding the content of the videos is still a challenging task. The aim of this challenge is to explore efficient ways to do content-based video relevance prediction tasks for recommender system."

    "## Task\n",
    "The high level task of this challenge is to understand the content of videos for recommender system. For the purpose of a competition, we need to define specific tasks as well as the data used in the competition. \n",
    "### The configuration of the competition\n",
    "In this competition, the task is to learn a model that can compute the relevance between TV-Shows/Movies from the video contents and the metadata (e.g. actor/actress, director, descriptions, genres, etc.). Specifically, there are 2 sets of items: 1) **retrieval** set $\\mathcal{R}$; 2) **candidate** set $\\mathcal{C}$, where $|\\mathcal{R}|=R $ and $|\\mathcal{C}|=C $. For each item (TV Show/Movie) $r$ in the retrieval set, we will provide several trailers and the metadata associated with them. Click [here](https://youtu.be/KNiVxwXn9CU) to have a quick look of a trailer. Besides the trailers and metadata, we also provide a vector $v^{(r)}\\in \\mathbb{Z}^C$, for each item  in the retrieval set, where $v^{(r)}_c=m$ indicates that candidate item $c\\in \\mathcal{C}$ is the $m$<sup>th</sup> relevant item among all the $|C|$ candidate items in $\\mathcal{C}$, $m\\in\\lbrace1,2,\\ldots,M\\rbrace$ and $v^{(r)}_c=0$ indicates that candidate item $c$ is not among the top $M$ most relevant items of item $r$. We only provide the top $M=30$ relevant items for each item $r$. The relevance we provided is learned from massive user behaviors and can be treated as groundtruth. And there is no overlap between $\\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mathcal{C}$, i.e. $\\mathcal{R} \\cap \\mathcal{C}=\\Phi$. Due to the legal issue, we provide neither the videos nor the metadata of the items in the **candidate** set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We divide the **retrieval** set $\\mathcal{R}$ into training set, validation set and testing set. The participants are expected to learn a model to compute the relevance (similarity) $w_{r^{\\star},r}$ between item $r^{\\star}$ in the testing set and item $r$ in the training set, based on videos and metadata we provided, and then use the relevance $w_{r^{\\star},r}$ to compute a vector $s^{(r^{\\star})}\\in \\mathbb{R}^C$, where $s^{(r^{\\star})}_c$ is a score indicating the relevance between $r^{\\star}$ with the candidate item $c\\in \\mathcal{C}$. For example, one option could be that \n",
    "$$s^{(r^{\\star})}_c = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{r=1}^N w_{r^{\\star},r}\\frac{\\mathbb{1}_{v_c^{(r)}\\neq 0}}{v_c^{(r)} + \\epsilon}$$ where $N$ is the number of items in the training set, $\\mathbb{1}_{v_c^{(r)}\\neq 0}$ equals to $1$ if $v_c^{(r)}\\neq 0$, and $0$ otherwise. The participants are free and encouraged to find other way to compute $s^{(r^{\\star})}_c$.\n",
    "### The Metric\n",
    "To measure the performance of models, we use ranking loss $\\mathcal{L}$ [1,2] as the metric, which measures the difficulty to derive the desiring ranking by the prediction of the models. More specifically, suppose the groundtruth top $M$ most relevant items in candidate set for item $r$ in the testing set is $o^{(r)} = [o_1^{(r)},o_2^{(r)},...,o_M^{(r)}]$ with order, where $o_i^{(r)} \\in \\mathcal{C}$ is the item in the candidate set that ranked at $i$<sup>th</sup> position in $o^{(r)}$, and $s^{(r)}_c$ is score indicating the predicted relevance by the model between item $r$ and item $o_i^{(r)}$, then the ranking loss is defined as: $$\\mathcal{L}(s,o) = - \\sum_{i=1}^M \\log \\frac{\\exp(s_{o_i})}{\\sum_{j\\in \\mathcal{C}\\setminus o_{:i-1}}s_{j}}$$ where $\\mathcal{C}\\setminus o_{:i-1}$ is a set containing all the candidate items in $\\mathcal{C}$ except the first $i-1$ items in $o$. In the above equation, we ignore the superscript $(r)$ for simplicity. We provide the python [**script**](https://github.com/CBVRP-ICIP-2017/CBVRP-ICIP2017/blob/master/metric/cbvrp_icip_metric.py) to compute the ranking loss.\n"
